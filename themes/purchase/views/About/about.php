<h1>About</h1>
<h7>Student Projects at Purchase College, SUNY</h7>
<ul>
	<li>The senior project is a collegewide requirement for the BA, BS, and some BFA programs. (Students majoring in <a href='http://www.purchase.edu/coursecatalog/current/AcademicPrograms/LSCE/LiberalStudies.aspx' target='_blank'>liberal studies</a> are required to complete a senior capstone course.) It is the hallmark of the Purchase educational experience and the signature of our curriculum. Students devote two semesters to an in-depth, original, and creative study, which may take the form of a research paper (laboratory or field), an exhibition, a piece of creative writing, or a translation.</li>
	<li>Projects from all Boards of Study from the <a href='http://www.purchase.edu/Departments/AcademicPrograms/las/' target='_blank'>School of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>, all Boards of Study within the <a href='http://www.purchase.edu/Departments/AcademicPrograms/Arts/ArtDesign/' target='_blank'>School of the Art+Design</a>, and the <a href='http://www.purchase.edu/Departments/AcademicPrograms/ce/' target='_blank'>School of Liberal Studies & Continuing Education</a> are represented in the digital repository. Art History and Art+Design master’s theses are also included in the digital repository. Presently, the digital repository only includes projects from 2012 to the present. The Library is currently digitizing and processing projects completed prior to 2012 to be added to the repository. To learn more about this process, please see the About page. To request a specific project that you cannot find in the digital repository, please contact us at <a href='lib.digitalcollections@purchase.edu' target='_blank'>lib.digitalcollections@purchase.edu</a>.</li>
	<li>The Student Projects digital repository provides free, public access, broad visibility, and long-term preservation for the scholarly and creative works created by Purchase College students. The Student Projects digital repository is built using a customized instance of <a href='http://www.collectiveaccess.org'>CollectiveAccess</a>, an open source digital asset management system for publishing library and archival collections.</li>	
</ul>

<h7>Digitization of Student Projects </h7>
<ul>
	<li>Print Student Project will be digitized using the Zeutschel OS 15000 Advanced Plus scanner. All projects will be scanned at 600dpi and processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Digitized files will be in a high compression PDF file format.</li>
	<li>Scanning standards are taken from federal guidelines for such items and can be found at <a href='http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov</a>.</li>
	<li>To request a specific project that you cannot find in the digital repository, please contact us at <a href='lib.digitalcollections@purchase.edu' target='_blank'>lib.digitalcollections@purchase.edu</a>.</li>

<h7>Preservation Statement</h7>
<p class='italics'>Purpose</p>
<div>Purchase College, SUNY has committed to the digital conversion, preservation, storage, maintenance, and public transmission of significant materials found in the Library’s collections. The purpose of providing access to these materials is to publish institutional history. This statement details the digital content that is and will be available to current and future users, as well as the selection process for conversion. In making policies and procedures public, Purchase College Library is establishing the authenticity, security, and accessibility of its digital collections. </div>

<p class='italics'>Scope & Selection Criteria</p>
<ul>
	<li>All Student Projects (senior projects, master’s theses, and capstone papers) submitted from the opening of the college in 1973 to the present will be digitized and culled into a single institutional repository.</li>
	<li>All campus publications from 1973 to the present will be digitized and culled into a single institutional repository (found in the same place as the senior projects but with different descriptive metadata).</li>
	<li>All Library archives born from institutional practice, or those given in whole or in part to the Library, will be assessed for historical, artistic, and institutional value, and digitized as staff time and technological equipment permits.</li>
</ul>

<p class='italics'>Lifecycle Management</p>
<div>The item is selected for conversion using the above criteria, then retrieved in physical form. The item is digitized in the Visual Resource Center, located in the Library. The format of the digital item, unless otherwise noted, will always be a highly compressed, fully OCR-ed PDF. This PDF will then be uploaded to the public side of the institutional repository and cataloged for discoverability, i.e. descriptive metadata will accompany each project so that each will be searchable by author, title, keyword, or major. After uploading, the item will be stored internally on a variety of backups, including external drives and with cloud storage. In adhering to this replication across storage platforms (drives, the cloud, public domain) master and use copies will be available for retrieval at all times and obsolescence of data formats will be averted. These digital conversion procedures adhere to widely accepted best practices for long-term maintenance and preservation of materials. As regards long-term maintenance, the items will be checked periodically in batches for bit rot and/or data loss. This statement will be updated to reflect any changes in data presentation, storage, and retrieval as needed.</div>

<p class='italics'>Maintenance</p>
<div>The Digital Collections Curator is responsible for ensuring that digital preservation policies, strategies, and procedures are created and maintained. The curator is responsible for the creation, implementation, and management of digital objects, supervises the preservation of digital objects, and advises on digital best practices. The preservation statement was written by the curator in residence 2016-2018. To address questions or concerns with this policy, please email <a href='mailto:lib.digitalcollections@purchase.edu'>lib.digitalcollections@purchase.edu</a>. </div>
