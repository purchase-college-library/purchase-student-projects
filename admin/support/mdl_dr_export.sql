Prior studies have suggested that mindfulness enhances working memory and that it can be most helpful to individuals with low self-regulation (Mrazek, Franklin, Phillips, Baird, & Schooler, 2013; Ramsburg & Youmans, 2013).  Previous studies have also suggested that the negative effects of stereotype threat on working memory and test performance can be diminished with the practice of mindfulness (Johns, Inzlicht, & Schmader, 2008; Weger, Hooper, Meier, & Hopthrow, 2012).  This study hypothesized that mindfulness would have a positive effect on the working memory capacity of individuals experiencing anxiety from stereotype threat, especially those with low self-regulation.  Students under stereotype threat and control subjects completed working memory tasks following a six-minute mindfulness or rest session.  They then completed a math quiz and a self-regulation questionnaire.  Students under stereotype threat who meditated did not perform better than the rest group on the working memory tasks or the math quiz in terms of accuracy.  However, the meditation group did have faster reaction time for correct responses than the rest group on the N-Back task.  There was no significant support that students with low self-regulation benefitted more from mindfulness than students with high self-regulation.  There was no significant difference in scores between the stereotype threat groups.  We have supported the hypothesis that meditation may increase working memory capacity in terms of task speed.  Meditation may cause an alleviation of working memory that reduces response time on simple working memory tasks.  Thus, it may serve to enhance processing speed during short-term memory-taxing tasks or improve multitasking abilities (Morgan, D’Mello, Abbott, Radvansky, Haass, & Tamplin, 2013).',	'meditation, mindfulness, stereotype threat, working memory, mathematics',	NULL,	1,	2014,	1,	'43780',	'Nancy Zook',	'19543',	'Yanine Hess',	NULL,	NULL,	'Jessica Carlisi_Psychology_May 2014.pdf',	'http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/purchase/seniorprojects/download.php?id=914184'),

Although much work has been done to ascertain the physiological mechanisms behind camouflage in teleosts, little is known about the energetic costs. To elucidate the metabolic demands of camouflage based on substrate color, ten juvenile peacock flounder were placed on dark, light, and patterned gravel. Opercular rates were recorded for two minutes and used as an indicator of energy expenditure.  Given that the pigment granules of dermal melanophores, a type of black-brown chromatophore largely responsible for changes in shade, appear to have a default state of dispersion, it was hypothesized that transitioning to light-colored gravel will be the most energetically expensive form of camouflage.

The researcher hypothesized that the high social status of an offender would evoke explicit moral reasoning in the punisher based on maintaining power structures, whereas lower status offenders would evoke explicit reasoning based on sensitivity to the costs associated with punishing the offender. We recruited 96 participants through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk Engine. Participants read a passage that described either a high-status offender (n = 44) or a low-status offender (n = 51) committing a transgression.  Unlike previous research findings, participants did not recommend more severe punishment for the high-status than low-status offenders. Status did not influence the extent to which participants reported that their judgment of the offender was influenced by a moral motive sensitive to power structures and deference. Participants who judged the low-status offender reported that their punishment decision was influenced by a moral motive sensitive to the costs associated with punishing the offender more than participants who judged the high-status offender.

A revival of the witch identity has emerged through the introduction of Wicca to the United States in the 1960s. These witches are unable to resist the pigeonholes set by the Salem Witch Trials. Modern and popular culture promote femininity of the witch creating little space for a male witch identity. These male witches are faced with a dual exclusion. The first degree of exclusion occurs on the basis of their religious beliefs and identity as witches; the second degree of exclusion occurs on the basis of being a male within an identity popularly perceived as female-dominated. This study examines the intersection of modern day society and the modern day witch. Content analysis of Wiccan ideas and beliefs conveyed through social media is used in conjuction with interviews of witches in order to understand the ways in which the witch identity is evolving around gender.

Maximin 3 is an AMP that has activity against a wide range of bacteria, fungal strains, tumor cells, and some viruses like HIV.  With such a range, this decreases the chance for resistance to develop against Maximin 3.  Using Fluorometer Anisotropy and Förster Resonance Energy Transfer Energy (FRET) analysis, the structural characterization of Maximin 3 can be understood.  Using both bacterial and mammalian cells, the binding of Maximin 3 to each membrane can be measured from the anisotropy, to see the affinity of binding between the peptide and the membrane.

The main finding was that storm damage and resultant canopy gaps have no significant effect on the presence of seedlings of either species. That means these species are not dependent on disturbance or stability for seedling recruitment. That adaptability may contribute to their invasiveness.

By understanding the differences and similarities between the two professions, women will be able to make educated decisions on what type of birth is appropriate for them. In American society, medical obstetricians may have a higher prevalence rate versus the midwife who has not gone to medical school. Midwives however, are used more frequently worldwide, and it seems through research, that American women who are educated on the processes of conception, embryonic and fetal development, and birth are more apt to use a midwife. Findings have shown that not only are infants who are born with the assistance of midwives healthier, but so too are the mothers. Far fewer medically unncessary procedures are done during the birth process when pregnant women use a midwife, such as epidurals, induction, episiotomies and cesareans. It has been found that one year after birth, infants from midwife-assisted births rank higher nutrtionally and educationally than infants born by obstetritions. Breastfeeding has become front and center with pediatricians, yet obstetricians along with hospital staff do not encourage this natural process.

A balanced diet, plentiful in dark leafy cruciferous vegetables such as kale, has been suggested as a way to delay progression of symptoms. Kale is rich in antioxidants and neuroprotective phytochemicals, including sulforaphane that has been shown to facilitate the clearance of plaques in the brain. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster is widely used to study human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s; transgenic flies carrying the mutant human Aβ42 gene replicate disease symptoms such as neurodegeneration, impaired locomotion and shorter lifespan. In this project I investigated the effects of kale supplementation in the fly’s diet on longevity, and on locomotive function assayed via measures of climbing ability at adult ages from 5-60 days. As a control, parallel assays were carried out on wild type Drosophila and on flies expressing mutant human Aβ42, but raised without kale supplementation. The results regarding whether the addition of kale had any effect on AD symptoms expressed by the flies were inconclusive due to inadequate replicates of the experiment and other experimental errors.

The primary goal of this study was to assess how tablet technology, such as the iPad, influenced prosocial behaviors in children aged one to five years. Parents with children enrolled in a childcare program were surveyed about their child’s exposure to and use of tablet technology.  Further, children’s teachers were surveyed about children’s use of technology in the classroom and their helping, sharing, and turn-taking behaviors. It was hypothesized that children who use more tablet technology would have less developed prosocial skills, whereas those who have not used tablet technology would have better developed prosocial skills. The results of this study suggest that as parents reported more technology use among their child, teachers reported fewer prosocial behaviors.  It is interesting to note that as parent perceptions of temperamental difficulty increased, age of first tablet technology use decreased. Parents of children with difficult temperaments may be more likely to give children tablets at earlier ages to calm or re-direct behavior.

Previous research suggests that videogame exposure leads players to overlook character stereotypes. The researcher hypothesized that players who self-identify as gamers will be less sensitized to the kinds of stereotypes in videogames than those who do not self-identify as gamers. We recruited 237 participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk to test whether videogame exposure leads to desensitization towards character stereotypes. Participants were given one out of two questionnaires that were identical besides stimulus type. One questionnaire consisted of 17 character screenshots while the other version consisted of 17 character descriptions. Each participant indicated their degree to which he/she self-identified as a gamer or not.  Results indicated that those who self-identified as gamers rated character stereotypes as significantly more stereotypical, inappropriate, and offensive than non-gamers. In the present study a matched sample was used to compare gamers versus non-gamers in order to control for possible effects of other variables.  The results were opposite the hypothesis, and what has been suggested from prior research. The sample used in the study was mostly Asian.

Since there are many similarities between breast and prostate cancer, and it is known that prostate cancer cell proliferation may be controlled by the nearby stromal cells, I hypothesized that a similar relationship might exist between breast cancer cell proliferation and breast cancer stromal cells. Stromal cells are a type of connective tissue found throughout the body. As a first step, I explored effects of I26Fi rat prostate stromal cells on NMU rat mammary tumor cells. Certain cell lines were used to investigate the interactions between breast and prostate cancer: NMU- a malignant rat derived breast cancer cell line, I26Fi- a malignant prostatic stromal cell line, and Rat2- a non-malignant rat fibroblast cell line. In this experiment, cell lines NMU, I26Fi, and Rat2 were cultured with RPMI-1640 with 1% FBS. Once the cell lines were confluent, 24, 48, and 72 hour supernatants were collected and frozen. NMU cells were cultured at 2x104 cells/ml for 3 or 6 days in the presence of supernatant at concentrations of 0, 25%, and 50% and observed for cellular proliferation. Methylthiazol Tetrazolium Assay (MTT) analysis indicates that the I26Fi cell line as well as the Rat2 cell line increased cellular proliferation of the NMU cells (as a control experiment, supernatants from Rat2, a non-malignant, non-prostatic fibroblast cell line, demonstrated similar stimulation of proliferation). This data suggests that fibroblast cell secretions that inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation have the opposite effect on mammary tumor cell proliferation.

Our results showed that there was little difference in the results for both forms of LA while the DHA expectedly lowered the amount of cell proliferation; although LA as a free fatty acid produced less cell proliferation at lower concentrations.

Economist Milton Friedman describes this process as &quot;cheap money drives out dear money&quot;, and it is known as Gresham\\\'s Law. Following the cessation of the free coinage of silver in 1873, the United States was on a strict gold standard. In 1896, Democratic Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan proposed a return to a bimetallic standard, giving debtors the ability to pay back their loans in gold or silver. Anybody who had a debt to pay would choose over-valued silver to make their payments, resulting in the withdrawl of gold money from circulation. This policy would have caused inflation of prices as over-valued silver coins were continuously minted. During this period at the end of the 19th century, farmers were suffering from low crop prices and were therefore unable to make enough money to keep up with their business loan payments, and the inflation Bryan desired would have helped them out of debt.

Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder prevalent among many elderly people. It is the most common form of dementia. Approximately sixty to eighty percent of patients with dementia in the United States of America suffer specifically from Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer\'s Association, 2012). Some early symptoms are memory impairment, difficulty recalling current events and names, and depression. This Senior Project evaluates the various treatments (non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical), stages, types of AD, Mini-mental Status Exam score, gender, age, and many other aspects, of these residents at Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. over a six month period. AD was more common among females and Caucasian in Cobble Hill Health Center. The sporadic type of AD was more abundant among these patients than early-onset and familial. As the ages of the majority these patients increased the severity of the disease increased also. Based on this research, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments did not seem to make a difference in the progression of AD in these participants over a six month period.',	'Alzheimer\'s Disease, Treatments, Types',	NULL,	1,	2012,	1,	'38902',	'Elysse Craddock',	'21970',	'Maryann Mcenroe',	NULL,	NULL,	'Grace Famodimu Senior Project complete 1.pdf',	'http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/purchase/seniorprojects/download.php?id=223777'),

In this project we used D. melanogaster as a control in comparing triglyceride levels between young, sexually immature, and older sexually mature Drosophila grimshawi, a large endemic Hawaiian fly species, to see if age and lipid content were positively correlated in both sexes. Flies of the two species have different dietary adaptations, but can be reared on laboratory diets.  Dried adult flies were weighed separately for each sex, then homogenized in phosphate buffer. Triglyceride levels in the supernatant were assayed via enzymatic reactions of lipase, glycerol kinase, 1-P-glycerol oxidase and peroxidase, using the Teco Diagnostics Triglyceride Reagent Set. Triglyceride levels of reproductively immature 12-day old D. grimshawi males (n=9) and females (n=9) were compared with those of reproductively mature 28-day old males (n=9) and females (n=9), using 5 day old D. melanogaster males (n=9) and females (n=9) as a control.

Heart rate variability is commonly used indicator for autonomic nervous system function.  Stress is one of the main stimuli of this system and can be seen in an individual\'s heart rate. In this study we used multiple stressors to elevate heart rate and test autonomic nervous system function. When presented with the stressor the heart rate should elevate. The stress stimuli were mental and physical represented by a puzzle and mild exercise. We used the iworx system to collect and analyze the heart rate variability of each participant after each task.  The subject pool (n=20) consisted of college students within an age bracket. The results of this study showed that though mental stress is not as strenuous ad physical the heart rate still responds.

That is, does processing information in one sensorimotor system (e.g., action) show a transfer effect in another sensorimotor system (e.g., vision)? After all, the actions we take on objects in the world are visually guided. Perhaps our action and object representations begin to overlap with one another as a function of this co-occurrence in our experience. This project tested whether  holding a gun increases the likelihood of seeing a gun in an image, and further examined how this effect might depend on an individual\'s motor history with guns. In three conditions, we varied participants\' hand posture while they viewed and responded to serially presented images. Participants responded either by raising a gun held canonically (holding a gun in the traditional way), raising a gun held non-canonically (holding a gun in a non-traditional way), and by raising a ball whenever they detected a gun in the image. We asked whether the type of grasp people used to make the response affected whether or not they reported a gun was present. The results suggest that holding a gun non-canonically relative to holding a ball makes people more likely to report seeing a gun in the scene.

Several hundred rotational transitions were measured for each molecule and line widths in this experiment were 8 kHz, full width at half maximum height. Each molecule produced spectra of sufficient intensity that all carbon-13 isotopologues could be observed in natural abundance. The spectra for each molecule have been analyzed using appropriate Hamiltonians in which the constants of the Hamiltonian have been least squares fitted to reproduce the observed rotational transition frequencies. The rotational constants are related to the moments of inertia of the molecule which in turn provide information on the molecules structure. Notably, the spectrum for octafluorocyclopentene showed two rotational transitions for every one transition anticipated.

Then the participants wee asked to sit in silence, listen to self-chosen music, or listen to music chosen by another participant. Skin conductance was used as a measure of autonomic arousal throughout. Participants took the emtional Stroop test before the emotional induction, after it, and after the music/silence phase to determine whether affective valence shifted throughout the study. There were no significant differences in emotional Stroop scores between conditions. There was a marginally significant difference in skin conductance levels during the recovery phase of the experiment between those in the silence condition and those who listened to music chosen by another participant.

This style of learning is informal. Informal learning experiences complement and enhance learning in formal places such as schools and universities. Given this understanding of the value of informal learning environments, this study explores the question, can an interpretive exhibit be used to create an effective interpretive opportunity, one that changes visitors’ attitudes and increase their knowledge about geology? During Spring Semester 2015, sixty-five freshmen not majoring in the sciences were invited to visit the newly completed exhibit.  Student experience with the exhibit was evaluated both by participants’ completion of a series of guided observational evaluations and a self-reflective activity. For comparison, a separate population of thirty-six freshmen not majoring in the sciences completed the same self-reflective activities, but did not visit the exhibit.  Results suggest the exhibit\'s interpretive scheme is effective as students who interacted with the exhibits were successfully able to identify the major themes conveyed in six out of the eight display cases (p-values from .000-.002).

Eighteen participants viewed visual motion and then judged the direction of a set of moving dots. To disambiguate the two reference frames, we varied participants\\\' head orientation between the adaptation and test phases of each trial. The difference in the direction of the MAE between trials where participants change versus maintain head orientation reveals the degree to which people adopt each reference frame.

In Experiment 1, participants read a short fictional story about a relationship where love was framed either as &quot;an uphill battle&quot; or &quot;a delicate flower.&quot; We hypothesized that if metaphorical framing guides how people encode and reason about the text, then the participants given the battle metaphor would be more likely to remember negative events from the story, but also more likely to believe the two characters would move in togeher (since arguments are part of love-as-a-battle schema). Though we did not find effects on memory, we did observe a significant effect in the predicted direction for one of the inference questions. In Experiment 2, participants read a brief description of the European Union where the EU was described either using &quot;body&quot; or &quot;patchwork&quot; metaphors. We predicated that participants given the &quot;body&quot; framing will be more likely to infer that activity in one country would affect another EU country because bodies are integrated systems and patchworks are not.

Societal efforts need to be made to reduce racial bias. This experiment investigated whether introducing a positive stimulus that is associated with the target race can reduce racial bias. Specifically, we attempted to reduce racial biases by introducing a positive pop song that was associated with a musician of a particular race. We assessed bias by having individuals complete the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is a task that tests the strength of the association between two concepts. We used the version of the IAT that tests the association between race and positive and negative terms. When each participant entered the lab, a pop song was playing and a Spotify screen showed a White musician or a Black musician. The experimenter had ostensibly been listening to the song before the participant came in, and she turned the song off after each participant completed the consent form. Participants then completed the IAT. IAT scores across the two conditions have the potential to reveal whether introducing a positive racial associate—something as simple as a song—can reduce racial bias.

Based on these findings, this study examined phobic avoidance and tested the mechanism proposed by Siegel et al. (2013), i.e., the hypothesis that the rate at which autonomic arousal habituates during VBE would predict its reduction of phobic avoidance. Nineteen female participants were identified with the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ; Szymanski & O\'Donohue, 1995), and a Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) with a live tarantula. One week later, they received one of two types of exposure: VBE to masked images of spiders or masked/very brief images of flowers (control). Autonomic arousal was measured continuously during exposure using skin conductance levels (SCLs). Phobic avoidance was measured with the BAT during a screening session and again one week later immediately after exposure to the masked stimuli. It was hypothesized that VBE would induce autonomic arousal relative to control that would habituate more quickly. It was also hypothesized that the rate of arousal habituation during VBE would predict the reduction of phobic behavior. The results showed that VBE did not induce more arousal than VBF, and that arousal induced by VBE habituated no faster or slower than that induced by VBF. VBE marginally reduced avoidance of the tarantula. Habituation of arousal during VBE did not predict its effect on phobic avoidance. These arousal results are not consistent with those of the aforementioned, prior VBE studies. VBE may have marginally reduced phobic avoidance because it limited awareness of the phobic stimulus, thus it may have reduced fear implicitly.',	'Fear; Masking; Exposure; Phobia',	NULL,	1,	2014,	1,	'27137',	'Paul Siegel',	'43780',	'Nancy Zook',	NULL,	NULL,	'The Effects of Very Brief Exposure on Autonomic Arousal and Phobic Avoidance.pdf',	'http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/purchase/seniorprojects/download.php?id=903495'),

Attentional control is an executive function requiring focus and alertness in a task. Cell phone use may disrupt focus and increase reaction time in tasks that require attention.  It is hypothesized that the presence of an alerting cell phone will reduce accuracy and increase reaction time on the Flanker task. Thirty-five participants completed six blocks of an attentionally demanding task while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In addition to the traditional Flanker task, two conditions were used. In one, a cell phone alarm vibrated every ten seconds; in the third condition, participants responded to the alarms by pressing a key on the task keyboard. There was a decrease in accuracy for responses to congruent and neutral stimuli in the cell phone interruption conditions in comparison to the control condition. There was also a decrease in the amplitudes and latencies of the P3 component in the ERP data for the responses to incongruent stimuli in the cell phone conditions. The results from this study indicate that with the presence of cell phones, accuracy may decrease in tasks requiring a moderate amount of attentional control, but not in difficult tasks requiring heavy attentional control.

In doing so, the circus (de)formed the circus freak and fetishized the (ab)normal body. In the 1970s circus attendance was drastically declining due to the typical acts becoming viewed as inhumane exhibitions of human difference and exotic animals. To accommodate the demand for humane acts, the circus institution created the new form of circus known as cirque. Cirque typically does not include animal acts, and is focused on beautiful, artistic composition seen in movement-art forms such as dance, gymnastics, and acrobatics.\r\nContinuing the traditions of the circus institution, cirque both depends on this history by existing at the boundaries of traditional culture and defining itself as an agent of progressive change in accordance with the demands for humanitarianism. Specifically, Cirque du Soleil, as according to their goals statement, “strives to position itself in the community as a responsible proponent of change.” Many scholars have used the humanitarian goal of cirque to justify cirque as an art form that breaks from traditional culture and in turn normalizes the diversity of (social) bodies.\r\nThis article critiques the assumption of cirque as an agent of progressive social change through discussions of how abnormal bodies are regulated, viewed, and made sense of within cirque. By pairing various forms of theory with interviews, content analyses, and field observations from Cirque du Soleil’s Amaluna, this article argues Amaluna as a performance that credentials itself by breaking the boundaries of traditional culture, while indirectly securing able-bodied heteronormativity and the nuclear family.',	'heterosexualitydisabilitycirqueCirque du Soleilsocial change',	NULL,	1,	2015,	1,	'12075',	'Chrys Ingraham',	'35188',	'Kristen Karlberg',	NULL,	NULL,	'Senior Project Casey Saunders (final).pdf',	'http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/purchase/seniorprojects/download.php?id=1352837'),

Previous research has suggested that individuals with ASD exhibit deficits in the identification of verbally-expressed emotions. Emotion is carried by a property of speech known as prosody, which is characterized by dynamically changing pitch patterns and temporal attributes. The auditory brainstem is responsible for the proper encoding of the changing pitch. However, it has been found that in people with ASD, the auditory brainstem is not able to track and encode prosody correctly. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for people with ASD to accurately perceive emotion. The current experiment investigated whether pitch perception training can result in improved perception of pitch and improved identification of emotion. Pitch perception and emotional identification were assessed prior to training and again after four perceptual training sessions. During each training session, participants listened to synthesized pitch contours that were originally derived from speech. During each session, participants listened to a stimulus, either a rising or descending pitch, and then indicated using the keyboard the direction of the pitch change. Accuracy was reinforced with immediate feedback. Participants were exposed to more than 500 changing pitches over the duration of the study. For the pre- and post-training emotional assessment, participants listened to 57 recorded phrases that communicated happiness, sadness, or anger and attempted to identify the emotion expressed by the speaker. Results indicated that participants with ASD improved their pitch tracking accuracy and emotional recognition.',	'Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism, Emotion, Prosody, Pitch Perception',	NULL,	1,	2015,	1,	'14565',	'Meagan Curtis',	'15642',	'Kay Germano',	NULL,	NULL,	'DanielleWilliams_PitchPerceptionandEncodingPitchContours.pdf',	'http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/purchase/seniorprojects/download.php?id=1359370'),

In light of the fact that consumers are now faced with seemingly infinite options, marketing efforts have become indispensible to successfully running a business. Concurrently, consumers are becoming resistant to traditional marketing efforts. In an effort to combat this Catch-22, businesses develop brand identities that elicit emotional resonance from their consumers and secure them a steady customer base. A popular way of going about this is to hire external, experiential brand marketing agencies who promise just that: to create experiences that will induce brand love, and therewith loyalty, in their client\\\'s product or services.

Prior research has found that there is a correlation between anxiety and the prevalence of alcohol and substance abuse (Cranford, Eisenberg, & Serras, 2009). There has also been research showing that anxiety precedes the use of alcohol and drugs (Swendson et al., 2010). The need for self-reliance is commonly reported as a barrier for young people to seek mental health treatment (Gulliver, Griffiths & Christensen, 2010). The objective of this study was to examine whether young adults with symptoms of anxiety who employ strategies of self-reliance were more likely to use drugs and alcohol and less likely to seek treatment. Males and females were also examined separately to see if there were any gender differences. Participants (n=350) aged 18-25 recruited through Purchase College and Mechanical Turk completed an online questionnaire including the Patient Health Questionnaire (Spitzer, Kroenke & Williams, 1999), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders & Monteiro, 2001), Drug Abuse Screening Test (Skinner, 1982), Barriers to Help-Seeking Scale (Mansfield, Addis & Courtenay, 2005), Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services (Mackenzie, Gekoski & Knox, 2006), and a one-item help-seeking intentions questionnaire (Deane & Chamberlain, 1994). The results of this study show anxiety predicted alcohol and drug use while self-reliance predicted treatment seeking attitudes and intentions. There were no significant gender differences. The implications of this study suggest that young people with anxiety may be at an increased risk for using alcohol and drugs, and if they feel strongly about the need to rely on themselves to cope they may be less likely to seek treatment. \r\n',	'anxiety, substance use, self-reliance, treatment seeking, young people',	NULL,	1,	2015,	1,	'9542',	'Ilyse Spertus',	'13669',	'Stephen Flusberg',	NULL,	NULL,	'SP-FINALDraft.pdf',	'http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/purchase/seniorprojects/download.php?id=1358903'),

Mentored students did participate more in class than non-mentored students and, unexpectedly, commuters made more references to grit and ethnicity than non-mentored students.
